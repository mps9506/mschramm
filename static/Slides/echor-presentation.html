# Get Started

---

Install the **echor** package from the CRAN repository:


```r
install.packages("echor")
```

--

if you are brave, install the development version from github:


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mps9506/echor")
```

---
**echor** utilizes the public web services of the EPA ECHO website to obtain a live feed of data from ECHO. 

- Uses URLs to download data from ECHO as a JSON file. 
- The package forms the URL, reads the JSON files, and formats it to a dataframe.

--

See the JSON yourself by testing this URL:

https://ofmpub.epa.gov/echo/cwa_rest_services.get_facility_info?output=JSON&amp;xmin=-96.407563&amp;ymin=30.554395&amp;xmax=-96.25947&amp;ymax=30.751984

<i class="fab  fa-chrome "></i> or <i class="fab  fa-firefox "></i> will show you the JSON data in a nice format for you to browse.

---
## Some notes before starting

- Requires internet connection

- Depends on EPA ECHO server

- Tons of available arguments, not all documented by me

- Nitty gritty details are here: https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services

---
## Demo 1

- Download effluent records from a permitted discharger


```r
library(echor)

df &lt;- echoGetEffluent(p_id = 'tx0119407', parameter_code = '50050')
```

--
- `p_id = NPDES identifier`

--
- parameter code 50050 returns discharge (mean and max)

```r

How about **E. coli*?

- Sometimes you need to try a few search terms

- escherichia coli returns nothing

- escherichia returns nothing

- try coli



```r
params &lt;- echoWaterGetParams(term = "coli")
params
```

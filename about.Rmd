I'm a researcher at the [Texas Water Resources Institute](http://twri.tamu.edu/) and Texas A&M AgriLife where I work on watershed planning and various water quality issues with stakeholders throughout the state of Texas.

I like using R and working with spatial GIS data to better understand the environmental outcomes of policy and management decisions.
